Hi ðŸ‘‹ I'm Estelle Corey. Welcome to my blog! It's nice to meet you. I made a New Year's resolution that I'd start blogging again in 2025. This is my first post and I'm feeling a bit rusty.

It was about seven years ago that I decided I wanted to be a Software Developer. At the time, I was an Industrial Engineer who was shifting more and more into scripting to solve problems. I decided to quit my job, focus all of my energy into Free Code Camp, and blog about it.

Eventually, I started front-end contracting and blogging faded away. A few years into that, I wanted more control of my projects. I started writing the back end code to support my front-end applications. A year after that, I wanted even more control over the whole application. What if I could build and deploy the app on my own? I started to learn about AWS Cloud Infrastructure. I started with AWS Copilot and eventually moved into building out the Infrastructure on my own.

I've really come to enjoy Infrastructure and all of the neverending details. I love how broad and specific it can be all at the same time. In the past year, I've started to get more interested in DevOps. The Industrial Engineer in me loves automation and continuous improvement.

I still build and deploy apps from time to time, but I've found that Infrastructure and DevOps have really become my passion. There's a neverending ocean of knowledge to learn and it feels like I'll never get bored.
