<p>Hi ðŸ‘‹ I&rsquo;m Estelle Corey. Welcome to my blog! It&rsquo;s nice to meet you. I made a New Year&rsquo;s resolution that I&rsquo;d start blogging again in 2025. This is my first post and I&rsquo;m feeling a bit rusty.</p>
<p>It was about seven years ago that I decided I wanted to be a Software Developer. At the time, I was an Industrial Engineer who was shifting more and more into scripting to solve problems. I decided to quit my job, focus all of my energy into Free Code Camp, and blog about it.</p>
<p>Eventually, I started front-end contracting and blogging faded away. A few years into that, I wanted more control of my projects. I started writing the back end code to support my front-end applications. A year after that, I wanted even more control over the whole application. What if I could build and deploy the app on my own? I started to learn about AWS Cloud Infrastructure. I started with AWS Copilot and eventually moved into building out the Infrastructure on my own.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve really come to enjoy Infrastructure and all of the neverending details. I love how broad and specific it can be all at the same time. In the past year, I&rsquo;ve started to get more interested in DevOps. The Industrial Engineer in me loves automation and continuous improvement.</p>
<p>I still build and deploy apps from time to time, but I&rsquo;ve found that Infrastructure and DevOps have really become my passion. There&rsquo;s a neverending ocean of knowledge to learn and it feels like I&rsquo;ll never get bored.</p>
